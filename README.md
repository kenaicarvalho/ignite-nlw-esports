## About

Full app with web, mobile and dedicated server developed during Rocketseat's NLW eSports week, which aims to connect gamers looking for a gaming duo.

The web project was built using the React framework with Typescript, while the mobile project was developed in React Native and Expo.

When accessing the web, it is possible to create advertisements for meeting a gaming partner. On mobile, there is access to such data, being able to connect with players through Discord.
